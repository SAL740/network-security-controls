# 9. Understanding Importance of Load Balancing in Network Security

Load balancers distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers, ensuring availability and reliability. They help prevent any single server from being overwhelmed and play a key role in mitigating denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, keeping services accessible and responsive.

Key benefits include:
- Improved fault tolerance and redundancy.
- Enhanced application scalability and performance.
- Protection against traffic spikes and malicious attacks.

By effectively managing traffic distribution, load balancers contribute significantly to maintaining a secure and resilient network infrastructure.
