# 8. Overview of Other Network Security Controls

In addition to core security measures, there are several other important network security controls that help organizations build a robust defense-in-depth strategy:

- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**
  Collects, analyzes, and correlates security events from across the network, providing centralized visibility, real-time alerts, and advanced threat detection.

- **Unified Threat Management (UTM):**
  Integrates multiple security functions—such as firewall, intrusion prevention, antivirus, and content filtering—into a single platform for simplified management.

- **Network Access Control (NAC):**
  Enforces security policies on devices attempting to connect to the network, ensuring only compliant and authorized devices gain access.

- **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR):**
  Automates threat detection, response, and remediation processes, helping security teams respond to incidents faster and more efficiently.

- **User Behavior Analytics (UBA):**
  Monitors and analyzes user activities to detect abnormal behavior that may indicate insider threats or compromised accounts.

These controls work together to strengthen network security posture, improve incident response, and reduce the risk of successful cyberattacks.
