# 1. Overview of Essential Network Security Protocols

Network security protocols are the foundation of secure digital communication. They ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and authentication as information moves across networks.

Key protocols include:
- **SSL/TLS:** Encrypts data for secure web communication (HTTPS), protecting information from interception.
- **IPsec:** Secures IP communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet, commonly used for VPNs.
- **SSH:** Provides secure remote access and command execution over unsecured networks.
- **Kerberos:** Delivers strong authentication for users and services in a networked environment.
- **SNMPv3:** Manages and monitors network devices with enhanced security features like encryption and authentication.

By implementing these protocols, organizations protect sensitive data from eavesdropping, tampering, and unauthorized access, forming a critical layer in any cybersecurity strategy.
