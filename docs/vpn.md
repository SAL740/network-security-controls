# 7. Overview of VPN and Its Importance in Network Security

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technology that creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and a remote server over a public or shared network, such as the Internet. This tunnel ensures that sensitive information remains confidential, tamper-proof, and protected from unauthorized access during transit[1][2][5].

**Key Benefits of VPNs:**
- **Confidentiality:** VPNs encrypt your data, making it unreadable to anyone who intercepts it, even on unsecured networks like public Wi-Fi[2][5].
- **Privacy:** By masking your IP address and routing traffic through a VPN server, your online activities remain anonymous and difficult to track[3].
- **Integrity and Authentication:** VPNs verify that data is not altered during transmission and that both endpoints are legitimate, protecting against tampering and replay attacks[4].
- **Remote Access:** VPNs enable employees to securely access company resources from anywhere, supporting remote work and site-to-site connectivity
